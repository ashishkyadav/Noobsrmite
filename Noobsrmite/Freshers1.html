            Learn programming. C/C++/Java/Python whatever suits you, but just learn any two languages. There is no point of learning more than 2 language all together.<br>
            For freshers i suggest you to go with C++/C. It will teach you computer fundamentals like nothing else. Start with the basic books like those by Sumita Arora, then gradually graduate to the ones by Herb Sutter and Scott Meyers. Its sufficient to learn C++ till the OOPS concept.<br>
            Once you are done with C++/C. Select the next language. Try to select Java or Python.<br>
            Here is the list of fields you can proceed for each language. Wisely choose one and proceed<br>
            By selecting JAVA you can work on folowing projects<br>
                
                > Android development<br>
                > Web Apps<br>
                > Windows Apps<br>

            By selecting Python you can work on folowing projects<br>
                
                > Machine Learning<br>
                 > Artificial Intelligience<br>
                 > API<br><br>
            
            Make Linux your desktop OS. Windows and Mac are great, but if you want to learn computer science the hard (and right) way, Linux should be your mantra. Don’t just get a laptop with Linux pre-installed. Get an empty laptop, learn how to install Linux, learn how to recompile the source code to make your custom Kernel.<br><br>
            Get familiar with command line. Also, try to use text editors like vi/nano/emacs.<br><br>
            Participate in Hackathons. This has many advantages, like above, it keeps you abreast of the bar you will likely to be required to meet in your professional career, because in hackathons you generally get to meet the cream of the crop. Whizkids. They will inspire you. Plus you will be able to stay in touch with niche topics, like Machine Learning, Image Processing. You don’t need to be an expert, but a basic knowledge always helps. Imagine your first month in Microsoft and it is Hackathon time. Everybody is submitting cool ideas, but you cannot, because you don’t know Machine Learning, and hence you don’t even know what it can possibly do. Your basic knowledge of Machine Learning can help you here. Hackathons also teach you to the process of learning new things rapidly. Today’s Hackathon is on Image Processing, tomorrow’s will be based on idea related to Deep Learning. Obviously you cannot master Deep Learning in one day (or even a year), so you will have to understand it quickly, its basics at least, and how to utilize it for the purpose at hand. This is a very useful skill in real life<br><br>
            Get to know your 3rd year/4th year seniors who are doing something great. <br><br>
             Join different CS related clubs <br><br>
             Go on a trip with your friends <br><br>
